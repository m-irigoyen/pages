Just run the update script whenever you want to download/update CATCH. This will download the single header version of CATCH and put it in include/catch/.

This script is python 3. If you're on windows and you have both python 2 and 3, you should either delete version 2 or install the python manager and invoke "py update.py" instead of "python update.py"
